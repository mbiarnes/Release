CREATE new release branches and local release branches..: 06.06.2014
*********************************************************
xx. > mvnallClean (to clean all /target directories)
xx. > gitall checkout -b 6.1.x from master (creates 6.1.x branches with 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT)
xx. > gitall checkout master (to switch back to master branches)
xx. > sh /home/kiereleaseuser/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/update-version-all.sh 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT
      (update master to the new 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT version)
xx. > droolsjbpm-tools didn't upgrade automatically. there was still a 6.1.0.qualifier (/home/kiereleaseuser/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-tools/drools-eclipse/org.drools.updatesite/category.xml)
      that were changed manually. the 6.1.0.qualifier had to be changed to 6.2.0.qualifier
xx. > sh /home/kiereleaseuser/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/update-version-all.sh 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT
      (update master to the new 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT version) - now it worked
xx. > check if all versions have been updated on master to 6.2.0.-SNAPSHOT
xx. > mvnallCleanInstall (checks if everything builds after version upgrade to 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT)
xx. > gitall status (to review on master if some files/directories shouldn't be added)
xx. > gitall add . (adds all modified files on master and brings them in the staging area)
xx. > gitall commit -m "upgrade to new version: 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT"
xx. > gitall pull --rebase (pulls changes from master and puts local commits on it)
xx. > gitall push origin/master master (pushes all version change commit to blessed repository)
xx. > gitall checkout 6.1.x (switches back to 6.1.x)
xx. > gitall push origin 6.1.x (pushes 6.1.x branches to blessed repository)


6.1.x is pushed to the blessed repository - all projects should have this branch. The version should be 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT
changes to master are pushed to the blessed directory - all projects on master branch should have as version 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT
master builds with 6.2.0-SNAPSHOT
6.1.x builds with 6.1.0-SNAPSHOT (r6.1.x is a copy of this branch)

CREATE Jenkins Job for 6.1.x..: 09.06.2014
*******************************
xx. > on jenkins clone each job of kie-6.0.x 
  xx. > change the suffix of each cloned job to XXX-6.1.x
  xx. > change the build job configuration to use the git repo branch, for example 6.1.x.
xx. > create a new view (kie-6.1.x)
xx. > regular expression should be: (drools(jbpm)?|optaplanner|guvnor|jbpm|kie|dashboard)[-a-zA-Z]*\-6\.1\.x
xx. > Alert the dev mailing list and the IRC channel that the branch has been made
  xx. > Remind everyone clearly that every new commit to master will not make the upcoming CR and Final release, unless they cherry-pick it to this new branch
